# kitchenstrument

Kitchenstrument is a in experimental music(?)/art(?)/performance(?) [[yikes]] trio. We came together to submit a proposal to  Sound Symposium XX

R Murray Shafer and use of image-sound relationships?

An initial goal would to avoid highly academic language or the urge to write as if this was a paper. That habit should be deconstructed in a sense to maintain a freedom of expression. Where can writing go if the improvisation of voice is used for impluses in text. is there audience? colaborative happenings within the form of a textual database that archives changes in thoughts and can over view the 'train' of thought. Will the intersections be as interesting as I imagine.

# The Newfangled Kitchen Party : Conception {bay}
Monday, July 22nd 2019 
Seal Cove, Conception Bay South - Newfounland & Labrador 

Invitation Concept
  Creative methods of communication that orginate in simply having to talk to someone. 
      1. Postcards + Word of Mouth 
      2. No formal venue or Postering techniques 
      3. Avoiding the systems of digital communication to encourage a more nuanced audience participation. 
      4. Familiar 
      
Working with the improvisational in not just the happening, but also in the connection with an audience. Approaching familiar faces and community. Can we operate without the mass media machine? What is the opposite of a media push - can we see the beginning of our process in the very organizing of a happening. is the organizing of a happening already conflicting? A coming together. The destruction of a mass public opens room for a community - a community that holds more semblance to a rural town. Township - Relationship - Communityship - Musicianship - Must practice and engage it in the process with intention? 
An initial practice. Practice in the process - process in practice.  

# Home Space - Vulnerability - Curation 
A wave of anxiety in opening the private space of home - new home... old home... family home. 

A return to rurality. A familiar calmness of just having the door open and trust in the community. The locals - steadfast characters in their place, though not in their expression.
Home as Respository? 
Cupboards of the home. Vaults, archive, library, bedroom, office, kitchen, les chambres, living room, bathroom, pantry, mud room, stairs, understairs, closets, drawers, fridge, garbage, sink, etc. 

Host - Vulnerability challenged and tested just as much as any practice. Duality of Hosting and Performance. Creation of Space and experience. Is there also safety in the performance when practiced in the home space. 
Control or lack there of exists or expected in this moment. Trust or knowing? Can the same be said for audience/partipipants/community/friends? 

Ownership in the home and communal / shared  or private spaces. 

# Regional Histories of the Digital

Gaston Bachelard (a postal clerk before becoming a known philosopher)/ The Poetics of Space 1958 - France 
"The role of epistemology is to show the history of the (scientific) production of concepts; those concepts are not just theoretical propositions: they are simultaneously abstract and concrete, pervading technical and pedagogical activity. This explains why "The electric bulb is an object of scientific thoughtâ€¦ an example of an abstract-concrete object."[14] To understand the way it works, one has to take the detour of scientific knowledge. Epistemology is thus not a general philosophy that aims at justifying scientific reasoning. Instead it produces regional histories of science." (wiki entry on Bachelard interests) 
    The role of epistemology in the development of the digital.
