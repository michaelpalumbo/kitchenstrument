Kitchenstrument is a in experimental music(?)/art(?)/performance(?) [[yikes]] trio. We came together to submit a proposal to  Sound Symposium XX

R Murray Shafer and use of image-sound relationships?

An initial goal would to avoid highly academic language or the urge to write as if this was a paper. That habit should be deconstructed in a sense to maintain a freedom of expression. Where can writing go if the improvisation of voice is used for impluses in text. is there audience? colaborative happenings within the form of a textual database that archives changes in thoughts and can over view the 'train' of thought. Will the intersections be as interesting as I imagine. 

Learning how to git with it
